# Docker Introduction

## Docker Introduction
- What problems we have with Traditional Infra?
  - Time Consuming
  - Need to perform install/configs on every server and every environment.
  - Need to keep resolving issues related to libraries and dependencies. {Like OS updates etc..}
  - Very hard to track changes across Dev/QA/Stagin environment.
  - Need more resources to handle day to day activities.

- Why do we need to use Docker?
  - **Flexible** :- Even the most complex application can be containerized.
  - **LightWeight** :- Conatiners are very light weighted since they leverage and share the host kernel.
  - **Portable** :- You can build locally, Deploy to cloud and run anywhere.
  - **Loosely Coupled** :- Highly self seficient and encapsulated.
  - **Scalable** :- Increase the number of containers anytime.
  - **Security** :- Highly isolated.
